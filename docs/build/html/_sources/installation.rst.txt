Installation
*************

The windupbox uses packer as well as VirtualBox in order to create the Vagrant Boxes.
So please make sure both are installed/downloaded and make sure that the path of packer is added to the PATH environment variable.

To install the tool clone the repository, navigate into the directory and run ``pip install .``.
Run ``fwinpacker -v`` afterwards to check whether the tool is ready to use.
