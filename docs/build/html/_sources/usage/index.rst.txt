How to create a Windows Box
****************************

This tool enables users to create Windows Vagrant Boxes in a short time.
It therefore uses packer and VirtualBox.
Therefore the user can choose the *windows version* (e.g. Windows 10), *version* (e.g. 21H1),
*edition* (e.g. Home), *language* (e.g. English), *architecture* (e.g. x64) of the system and can customize the box in a lot of different ways.
A detailed overview and explanation can be found in the section :doc:`customizations`.
After the system choice the tool will download the regarding system image from the microsoft website.
Alternatively it is also possible to provide the system image by the -iso option.
Afterwards the tool will install Windows using packer.
Due to the large amount of different windows versions, editions and so on, not all could be tested so far.
So if a special windows version is not working for you feel free to create a github issue or build a custom class for that version or edition.
An tutorial on how to do that with less effort can be found in ... .


To create a Vagrant Box for Windows you can run ``fwinpacker boxcreate %WINDOWSVERSION% %VERSION% %EDITION% %LANGUAGE% %ARCHITECTURE%``.
As an example order to see the possible version for Windows
